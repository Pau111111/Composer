Composer - Dependency Management for PHP
========================================

Composer is a tool that manages the dependencies of our PHP project. Thanks to this tool, we can work with the installation of libraries that our project needs in a comfortable way, avoiding all the problems that involve installing the dependencies manually and without any control or supervision.

The dependencies are installed in a directory (default called /seller). What if my bookstores depend on others? It is also able to solve that and download everything necessary for it to work and thus avoid doing so manually.
